## ✨ Features

- 📈 **Linear Regression Model**: Predicts calories burned based on exercise data.
- 📊 **Data Exploration**: Visualizes relationships between features (e.g., time spent on exercise, intensity) and calories burned.
- ✏️ **User Input**: Allows users to input custom data to make predictions using the model.

## 🔍 Model Information

The app uses a `LinearRegression` model to analyze the provided exercise data (`calories_and_exercis.ipynb`) and predict calories burned. The model is trained using variables such as:

- ⏱️ **Exercise Duration**
- 💪 **Exercise Intensity**
- ➕ **Other features (as available in the dataset)**

The dataset and model training are integrated within the app, allowing for real-time predictions.
